                <h2>U-LEAF's e-GIF Policy for Accessibility and Usability</h2>
                <p>U-LEAF technical policies for providing accessibility and usability are:</p>

<ul><li>U-LEAF will be designed to meet UK legislation and to support channels that provide accessibility for disabled people.
<li>U-LEAF will be designed to meet the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA 1995) and the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 (DDA 2005). 
<li>U-LEAF will be designed so that anyone with an impairment that affects their use of this equipment is not disadvantaged or excluded by these systems.
<li>Designers and developers of U-LEAF are to be fully aware of, and complying with a set technical standards for accessibility and useability specified in the guidelines below.
</ul>
<p></p>
                <a name="table14"></a>
                <h2>Table 14: Specifications for Accessibility and Usability</h2>
                <p>For those unfamiliar with accessibility issues pertaining to Web page design, consider that many users may be operating in contexts very different from your own:</p>
                <ul>
                
                <li>They may not be able to see, hear, move, or may not be able to process some types of information easily or at all.
<li>They may have difficulty reading or comprehending text.
<li>They may not have or be able to use a keyboard or mouse.
<li>They may have a text-only screen, a small screen, or a slow Internet connection.
<li>They may not speak or understand fluently the language in which the document is written.
<li>They may be in a situation where their eyes, ears, or hands are busy or interfered with (e.g., driving to work, working in a loud environment, etc.).
<li>They may have an early version of a browser, a different browser entirely, a voice browser, or a different operating system.
                
                </ul>
                <p></p>
                <p>U-LEAF Designers and developers must consider these different situations during application design. While there are several situations to consider, each accessible design choice generally benefits several disability groups at once and the U-LEAF users as a whole. For example, by using style sheets to control font styles and eliminating the FONT element, HTML authors will have more control over their pages, make those pages more accessible to users with low vision, and by sharing the style sheets, will often shorten page download times for all U-LEAF users.</p>
                <a name="guidelines_organise"></a>
                <h2>How the Guidelines are Organized?</h2>
                <p>Unisys includes fourteen guidelines, or general principles of accessible design. Each guideline includes:
                  
<ul><li>The guideline number.
<li>The statement of the guideline.
<li>Guideline navigation links. These links allow navigation to the sections in the styleguide where you could find further information and how Unisys attempted to address the recomendations while designing U-LEAF application (setion name with hyperlink).
<li>Unisys comments about how U-LEAF addressed each guidelines if applicatible. And if a particular guideline is not relevant to the application, that will be indicated as status icon (Completely following, Not following, Not applicable ) .
<li>A list of checkpoint definitions.</ul></p>

            
            	<a name="priorities"></a>
                <h2>Priorities</h2>
            	<p><strong>Priority 1: </strong>U-LEAF Styleguide satisfied the Priority level 1 checkpoints as listed in the table. U-LEAF developers and designers <strong>must</strong> satisfy this checkpoint.  Satisfying this checkpoint is a basic requirement for some user groups to be able to use U-LEAF application.</p>
                <p><strong>Priority 2 :</strong> U-LEAF developers <strong>should</strong> satisfy this checkpoint. Otherwise, one or more groups will find it difficult to access information in the document. Satisfying this checkpoint will remove significant barriers to accessing Web documents. Currently U-LEAF satisfied all applicable priority chekpoints 1 and it is adviced to address priority 2 checkpoints as much possible. For example Keyboard Access guidelines are priority 2, but it is recommended to satisfy this requirement.</p>
                <p><strong>Priority 3</strong> : A Web content developer <strong>may</strong> address this checkpoint. Otherwise, one or more groups will find it somewhat difficult to access information in the document. Satisfying this checkpoint will improve access to Web documents. <strong>Currently U-LEAF is not addressed priority 3 checkpoints.</strong></p>

If color alone is used to convey information, people who cannot differentiate between certain colors and users with devices that have non-color or non-visual displays will not receive the information.

                    <p>Ensure that information is not conveyed through color alone. For example, when asking for input from users, do not write "Please select an item from those listed in green." Instead, ensure that information is available through other style effects (e.g., a font effect) and through context (e.g,. comprehensive text links).</p>
                    <p class="bolder">
                    Example: A form with required fields</p>

<p>A form contains several required fields. The labels for the required fields are displayed in red. In addition, at the end of each label is an asterisk character, *. The instructions for completing the form indicate that "all required fields are displayed in red and marked with an asterisk *", followed by an example.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Asterisks may not be read by all screen readers (in all reading modes) and may be difficult for users with low vision because they are rendered in a smaller size than default text. It is important for authors to include the text indicating that asterisk is used and to consider increasing the size of the asterisk that is presented.</p>

                    <td><strong>Use markup and style sheets and do so properly</strong>: <p>Mark up documents with the proper structural elements. Control presentation with style sheets rather than with presentation elements and attributes. Using markup improperly hinders accessibility. Misusing markup for a presentation effect (e.g., using a table for layout or a header to change the font size) makes it difficult for users with specialized software to understand the organization of the page or to navigate through it. Furthermore, using presentation markup rather than structural markup to convey structure (e.g., constructing what looks like a table of data with an HTML PRE element) makes it difficult to render a page intelligibly to other devices.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Checkpoints</h4>
                    <a name="checkpoint_3.1"></a>
                    <p><strong>1.</strong>When an appropriate markup language exists, use markup rather than images to convey information. [Priority 2] <span class="center"><img src="images/icons/icon_tick.png" width="16" height="16" alt="DONE" /></span></p>
                    <p>Using markup (and style sheets) where possible rather than images (e.g., a mathematical equation) promotes accessibility for the following reasons:
					<ul><li>Text may be magnified or interpreted as speech or braille.
						<li>Search engines can use text information.</ul><p></p>
                        <a name="checkpoint_3.2"></a>
                    <p>2. Use style sheets to control layout and presentation. [Priority 2] <span class="center"><img src="images/icons/icon_tick.png" width="16" height="16" alt="DONE" /></span>   [Link: <a href="css.htm">CSS</a>]</p>
                    <p class="bolder">Example</p>
                    <p>The proper HTML elements should be used to mark up emphasis: EM and STRONG. The B and I elements should not be used; they are used to create a visual presentation effect. The EM and STRONG elements were designed to indicate structural emphasis that may be rendered in a variety of ways (font style changes, speech inflection changes, etc.). Do not use tables for layout unless the table makes sense when linearized. Otherwise, if the table does not make sense, provide an alternative equivalent (which may be a linearized version).</p>
                    <a name="checkpoint_3.3"></a>
                    <p>3. Use relative rather than absolute units in markup language attribute values and style sheet property values. For example, in CSS, use 'em' or percentage lengths rather than 'pt' or 'cm', which are absolute units. If absolute units are used, validate that the rendered content is usable. [Priority 2]<span class="center"><img src="images/icons/icon_tick.png" width="16" height="16" alt="DONE" /></span></p>
                    <p class="bolder">Example</p>
                    <ul>

Tables for any use also present special problems to users of screen readers. Some user agents allow users to navigate among table cells and access header and other table cell information. Unless marked-up properly, these tables will not provide user agents with the appropriate information. (Refer also to guideline 3.)

<p><strong>2</strong>. For data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column headers, use markup to associate data cells and header cells. <strong>For example,</strong> in HTML, use THEAD, TFOOT, and TBODY to group rows, COL and COLGROUP to group columns, and the "axis", "scope", and "headers" attributes, to describe more complex relationships among data. <span class="center"><img src="images/icons/icon_cross.png" width="16" height="16" alt="NOT DONE" /></span></p>


<div class="example"><strong>Example.</strong> 

<p>This example shows how to associate data cells (created with <a href="#edef-TD">TD</a>) with their corresponding headers by means of the "<a href="#adef-headers">headers</a>" attribute. The "headers" attribute specifies
a list of header cells (row and column labels) associated with the current data
cell. This requires each header cell to have an "id" attribute.</p>

<p>The next example associates the same header (TH) and data (TD) cells as before, but this time uses the "scope" attribute rather than "headers". "Scope" must have one of the following values: "row", "col", "rowgroup", or "colgroup." Scope specifies the set of data cells to be associated with the current header cell. This method is particularly useful for simple tables. It should be noted that the spoken rendering of this table would be identical to that of the previous example. A choice between the "headers" and "scope" attributes is dependent on the complexity of the table. It does not affect the output so long as the relationships between header and data cells are made clear in the markup.</p>

                    <h4>Checkpoints</h4>
                    <a name="checkpoint_12.1"></a>
                   <p>1. Title each frame to facilitate frame identification and navigation. For example, in HTML use the "title" attribute on FRAME elements. <span class="center"><img src="images/icons/icon_not_applicable.png" width="16" height="16" alt="NOT Applicable" title="Not Applicable"/></span></p>
        <a name="checkpoint_12.2"></a>
        <p>2. Divide large blocks of information into more manageable groups where natural and appropriate. For example, in HTML, use OPTGROUP to group OPTION elements inside a SELECT; group form controls with FIELDSET and LEGEND; use nested lists where appropriate; use headings to structure documents, etc <span class="center"><img src="images/icons/icon_tick.png" width="16" height="16" alt="DONE" /></span></p>
        
        <p>Content developers should group information where natural and appropriate. When form controls can be grouped into logical units, use the FIELDSET element and label those units with the LEGEND element:</p>
        <div class="example">
<p><strong>Example.</strong></p>

<pre>&lt;FORM action="http://example.com/adduser" method="post"&gt;
   &lt;FIELDSET&gt;
   &lt;LEGEND&gt;Personal information&lt;/LEGEND&gt;
   &lt;LABEL for="firstname"&gt;First name: &lt;/LABEL&gt;
   &lt;INPUT type="text" id="firstname" tabindex="1"&gt;
   &lt;LABEL for="lastname"&gt;Last name: &lt;/LABEL&gt;
   &lt;INPUT type="text" id="lastname" tabindex="2"&gt;
   ...more personal information...
   &lt;/FIELDSET&gt;
   &lt;FIELDSET&gt;
   &lt;LEGEND&gt;Medical History&lt;/LEGEND&gt;
   ...medical history information...
   &lt;/FIELDSET&gt;
&lt;/FORM&gt;
</pre>

<p class="off">End example.</p>
</div>
		<a name="checkpoint_12.3"></a>
        <p>3. Associate labels explicitly with their controls. For example, in HTML use LABEL and its "for" attribute. <span class="center"><img src="images/icons/icon_tick.png" width="16" height="16" alt="DONE" /></span> [Link: <a href="standards.htm#forms">XHTML and Semantic Mark-up Standards</a>]</p>  
        <p>A label is implicitly associated with its form control either through markup or positioning on the page. The following example shows how a label and form control may be implicitly associated with markup.</p>
        <div class="example">
<p><strong>Example.</strong></p>

<pre>   &lt;LABEL for="firstname"&gt;First name: 
     &lt;INPUT type="text" id="firstname" tabindex="1"&gt;
   &lt;/LABEL&gt;

</pre>

<p class="off">End example.</p>
</div>          
                    </td>
                    <td class="center"><img src="images/icons/icon_tick.png" width="16" height="16" alt="DONE" /></td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td class="top"><a name="checkpoint_13"></a>13</td>
                    <td><p><strong>Provide clear navigation mechanisms.</strong><br />
                      :Provide clear and consistent navigation mechanisms -- orientation information, navigation bars, a site map, etc. -- to increase the likelihood that a person will find what they are looking for at a site. Clear and consistent navigation mechanisms are important to people with cognitive disabilities or blindness, and benefit all users.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Checkpoints</h4>
                    <a name="checkpoint_13.1"></a>
                   <p>1. <strong>Clearly identify the target of each link. </strong>Link text should be meaningful enough to make sense when read out of context -- either on its own or as part of a sequence of links. For example, in HTML, write "Information about version 4.3" instead of "click here". In addition to clear link text, content developers may further clarify the target of a link with an informative link title (e.g., in HTML, the "title" attribute). <span class="center"><img src="images/icons/icon_tick.png" width="16" height="16" alt="DONE" /></span></p>
                   <div class="example">
<p><strong>Example.</strong></p>

<pre>  &lt;A href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101125071500/http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/my-doc.html"&gt;My document is available in HTML&lt;/A&gt;,
  &lt;A href="my-doc.pdf" title="My document in PDF"&gt;PDF&lt;/A&gt;,
  &lt;A href="my-doc.txt" title="My document in text"&gt;plain text&lt;/A&gt;
</pre>

<p class="off">End example.</p>
</div>
		<a name="checkpoint_13.2"></a>
        <p>2. Use navigation mechanisms in a consistent manner. <span class="center"><img src="images/icons/icon_tick.png" width="16" height="16" alt="DONE" /></span></p>       <p>Note: A consistent style of presentation on each page allows users to locate navigation mechanisms more easily but also to skip navigation mechanisms more easily to find important content. This helps people with learning and reading disabilities but also makes navigation easier for all users. Predictability will increase the likelihood that people will find information at your site, or avoid it when they so desire.</p>
        
        <a name="checkpoint_13.3"></a>
        <p>3. Provide navigation bars to highlight and give access to the navigation mechanism. <span class="center"><img src="images/icons/icon_tick.png" width="16" height="16" alt="DONE" /></span></p>  
        <p>Note: Providing navigation bars, site maps, and search features all increase the likelihood that a user will reach the information they seek at your site. If your site is highly visual in nature, the structure might be harder to navigate if the user can't form a mental map of where they are going or where they have been. To help them, content developers should describe any navigation mechanisms. It is crucial that the descriptions and site guides be accessible since people who are lost at your site will rely heavily on them.</p>

        <a name="checkpoint_13.4"></a>
        <p>4. If search functions are provided, enable different types of searches for different skill levels and preferences.<span class="center"><img src="images/icons/icon_not_applicable.png" width="16" height="16" alt="NOT Applicable" title="Not Applicable"/></span></p>   
                    </td>
                    <td class="center"><img src="images/icons/icon_tick.png" width="16" height="16" alt="DONE" /></td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td class="top"><a name="checkpoint_14"></a>14</td>
                    <td><p><strong>Ensure that documents are clear and simple.</strong>:<br />
                      Ensure that documents are clear and simple so they may be more easily understood. Consistent page layout, recognizable graphics, and easy to understand language benefit all users. In particular, they help people with cognitive disabilities or who have difficulty reading. (However, ensure that images have text equivalents for people who are blind, have low vision, or for any user who cannot or has chosen not to view graphics. Refer also to guideline 1.)</p>
<p>Using clear and simple language promotes effective communication. Access to written information can be difficult for people who have cognitive or learning disabilities. Using clear and simple language also benefits people whose first language differs from your own, including those people who communicate primarily in sign language.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Checkpoints</h4>
                    <a name="checkpoint_14.1"></a>
                   <p>1. Use the clearest and simplest language appropriate for a site's content.<span class="center"><img src="images/icons/icon_tick.png" width="16" height="16" alt="DONE" /></span> [Link: <a href="usability.htm">Usability &amp; Information Architecture Standards</a>]</p>
